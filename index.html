								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>My name is Ashwin Balaji and I am a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing a 
									BSE and MSE in Computer Science. I’m interested in using my skills at the intersection of finance, machine learning, data science/modeling, software development, and team-based project work. I'm currently a software engineer intern at CME Group, where, using Java and Python, I am working on developing a spread pricing algorithm for options and futures with legs in different price units, as well as building out a latency prediction model to accurately measure latency of time-series orders that enter and exit FALCON, the team's match engine.
									Previously, I had the opportunity to intern for Siemens Digital, where I added a 'Partner Search' feature to their Integrated Country Planning application, allowing Siemens country planners to connect and reach out to alliance partners for assistance in reselling/delivering products and solutions. I recently was invited to the Susquehana International Group (SIG) software discovery day where I learned about trading and software engineering roles from current executives and employees. I also previously had the ability to conduct Machine Learning research at Michigan State University, where I developed semi-supervised data classification models, such as KNN, Neural Network, SVM, and Random Forest models and compared them across a graph-based semi-supervised algorithm developed by my mentor and her team, a graph-based modification of the classical Merriman Bence Osher scheme. I published a paper in the journal JEI, linked <a href="https://emerginginvestigators.org/articles/similarity-graph-based-semi-supervised-methods-for-multiclass-data-classification/pdf" color = green>here</a>.
									I have taken relevant coursework in Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms, Cloud Computing, and Big Data. Outside of school, I am a part of my university's bollywood fusion dance team, Penn Dhamaka, and am an avid percussionist on the South Indian mridangam, having played for the last 10 years of my life. </p>

								<p>Under Professor Ekaterina Rapinchuk at MSU, I analyzed graph based semi-supervised machine learning algorithms against traditional methods in Python. I tested a graph-based adaptation of Merriman-Bence-Osher Scheme in comparison with 4 supervised classification algorithms. I also presented my findings at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research and the Sigma Xi conference. I published an article in JEI, linked <a href="https://emerginginvestigators.org/articles/similarity-graph-based-semi-supervised-methods-for-multiclass-data-classification/pdf">here</a>.</p>

								<li class="" href = "#">
									<h3>Facebook Clone</h3>
									<p>We developed a “Mini-Facebook” web application using Node/Spark for backend, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for frontend, and AWS DynamoDB for data storage. The app allows users to log in, post status updates, view friends’ homepages/posts, and chat with friends, as a well as a spark-based news-adsorption algorithm to recommend news articles users might like based on their interests. </p>
									<a href="https://github.com/abalaji157/FacebookReplica" class="button">Code</a>
								</li>
								<li class="">
									<h3>Flight Optimizer</h3>
									<p>We developed a Flight Optimizer web application using Node/SQL for backend, and React/GoogleMaps API for frontend. The application provides users with airline routes for round-trip flights, a hotel and attraction finder, where users can find attractions and filter by attraction type as well as distance from their city, an optimal itinerary planner, where users can enter in up to 3 cities and get the most optimal itinerary, minimizing layovers, as well as a complete trip guideline with attractions and airports along the way. The application also supports a statistic checker for Top 10 busiest airlines by country and airports by airline.</p>

								</li>
								<li class="">
									<h3>Health Correlation Analysis</h3>
									<p>Although there have been many studies about how various economic and social predictors can be used to predict health indicators, we were curious to explore the relationship between this predictability and health indicators by age. We explore several correlations in our dataset between health and economic welfare, using Neural Networks as well as various Regression models in Python.</p>
									<a href="https://github.com/abalaji157/healthCorrelator" class="button">Code</a>
								</li>
								<li class="">
									<h3>LC3 Compiler</h3>
									<p>I designed a compiler in C for the LC3 assembly language that generated executable binary files from assembly language, and updated a CPU-like struct in C, complete with registers, memory, and switches. I also implemented a disassembler to convert binary files back to assembly files.
